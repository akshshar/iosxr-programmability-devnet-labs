<p>Although the DevNet git repository provides a Web-based GUI, installing a <code>git</code> client on your own workstation will simplify the management of your repository-based content. You can then nteract with the DevNet repository from the command line on your local workstation or from within a GUI-based repository browser, such as <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">Atlassian SourceTree</a></p>

<p>Many modern operating systems provide a pre-installed <code>git</code> client; to see whether <code>git</code> is already installed on your OS, open a terminal window and type <code>git --version</code> at the command prompt; if the response provides a <code>git</code> version number, you're ready to use <code>git</code>:</p>

<p><code>$ git version 2.9.3 (Apple Git-75)</code></p>

<p>If the response does not provide a <code>git</code> version number, <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">visit this page to install git</a>. This page describes how to install git for mac, win, linux and from source. Of the Windows options, perhaps installing the GitHub client is easiest; it installs the command line tools in PowerShell as well. After you add your account info, you'll arrive at a page that asks you to choose a repository. If you are installing GitHub for Windows just to get the command-line tools that you need to complete the installation of the DevNet Learning Lab Previewer, you can skip the rest of the setup and take the following steps to launch the git command line tools in PowerShell:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the window.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Open in Git Shell</strong>.</li>
<li>To make sure git is working correctly, type <code>git --version</code> and press the <strong>Enter</strong> key. If you see a response such as <code>git version 2.10.2.windows.1</code> you are now able to execute the shell-based git commands in the instructions for installing the LLP tool.
</ol>

<p> After verifying that <code>git</code> is installed and running on your workstation, you might want to install <a="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">Atlassian SourceTree</a>, too. (Mac only)</p>
