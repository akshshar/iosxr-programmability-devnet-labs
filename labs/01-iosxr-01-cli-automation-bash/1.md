# Prelude
If you've been busy developing or utilizing external tools that help automate the IOS-XR CLI over Telnet/SSH using expect style send/receive transactions, then it is time to take a look at the new ZTP hooks embedded on the device. In this lab, we look at ZTP bash hooks, enabling you to deterministically handle IOS-XR CLI automation across show commands, config-apply, config-replace and more, using on-box bash scripts or remote bash commands.

## Objectives

* Reserve and Familiarize yourself with the IOS-XR Devnet Sandbox
* Understanding the ZTP infrastucture in IOS-XR
* Familiarize yourself with the ZTP bash helper library
* Write your first onbox IOS-XR CLI bash script
* Automate IOS-XR CLI using bash commands over SSH
* Extend remote bash execution capabilitiesto Config Management tools like Ansible, puppet etc.
