## Step 6. Installing and Running the Learning Lab Previewer Tool in Docker

Markdown previewers vary in their rendering capabilities as well as in their interpretations of various flavors of Markdown. To preview your lab content, run a Docker container with a previewer tool.

Before you run the command below, update the path below to the full path to your labs directory you want to test.

```
Run docker run -p "9000:9000" -p "35729:35729" -v "{full path to labs directory}/labs:/opt/labs" containers.cisco.com/asroach/learning-labs-previewer:latest
```
