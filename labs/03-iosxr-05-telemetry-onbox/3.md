# Understand App-Hosting on IOS-XR

Post Release 6.0.0, IOS-XR made a jump from a 32-bit QNX operating system to a 64-Bit Linux operating system. This 64-bit Linux environment with a modern Kernel and the ability to run Linux processes and applications from the larger Linux ecosystem enables a whole variety of new use cases.

## Breaking down the IOS-XR Software Architecture  

The Deployment Architecture of IOS-XR on compatible platforms can be classified into two types:

Irrespective of the LXC or VM based architecture, the common components of the architecture are defined below:

* **Host(Hypervisor)**: This is the underlying 64-bit Operating system that acts as the hypervisor on top of which the XR LXC/VM and the Admin LXC/VM are spawned. For LXC based platforms, it provides the shared kernel for the system. It also runs the container/VM daemons like libvirt and docker to spawn the XR and Calvados instances or even user spawned LXC/Docker instances (on LXC based platforms).  

* **XR LXC/VM**:  The IOS-XR control plane processes as shown in green above, run within an isolated LXC (on most contemporary IOS-XR platforms such as the NCS55xx and NCS5xxx platforms) or within an isolated VM (on the ASR9k platform).    

 This LXC/VM contains all of the IOS-XR control plane processes (Protocol Stacks such as BGP, ISIS, OSPF, Internal Database - SYSDB, APIs etc. ).

 For VM-Based platforms, the XR VM brings its own kernel and the runs the libvirt daemon and the docker daemon inside the XR VM. Consequently the User LXC/Docker containers are spawned inside XR VM unlike LXC-Based platforms where the user containers are spawned on the Host kernel.

* **Admin LXC/VM**: Also called `Calvados`, the Admin LXC/VM is the first instance that comes up once the Host layer is up. The Admin LXC/VM then helps handle the lifecycle of the XR LXC/VM. The primary purpose of Calvados was to enable multi-tenancy on the same router by spawning multiple IOS-XR instances that act as logical separate routers (Secure domain routers or SDRs).

For most operations, you will mostly deal with the just the XR LXC/VM on an IOS-XR platform.

Throughout the rest of the lab our focus will be on more contemporary platforms such as NCS55xx and NCS5xxx that are LXC-Based systems.



## Types of Linux Applications on IOS-XR

Linux applications supported by IOS-XR can be classified into two types:

*  <u>**Native Applications**</u>: An application that runs within the same process space as XR control-plane processes (BGP, OSPF, SYSDB etc.) is considered a native application. In either type of deployment as shown above, the native application runs inside the XR LXC/VM.  

    There is an obvious red-flag when it comes to native applications that there is no well defined method to constrain the amount of resources (CPU, Memory, Disk) that a native application utilizes on the system.  
    **It is up to the native application itself to police itself in its use of CPU, memory, Disk and other resources on the system**.  
    However, the advantage is the amount of visibility (file system access, XR processes information etc.) that a native application has on the system. This is why most configuration management tool clients (like puppet-client, chef-client, salt-minion are ) end up being native applications. Another example is auditing apps, for example the xr-auditor which actually runs within XR, Admin as well as the Host layer natively:
    ><https://xrdocs.io/application-hosting/blogs/2018-05-01-anatomy-of-a-network-app-xr-auditor/>

*  <u>**Container applications**</u>: Container applications require a container daemon available to launch the container on an available shared kernel on the system.  The container daemon could be libvirt (LXCs) or the Docker Daemon(Docker Containers).

  As shown in the figures above, the User managed container would be launched on the Host Layer in case of LXC-Based platforms and inside XR VM in case of VM-Based platforms.

  **The advantage** of Container based applications is the resource isolation that is achieved by containerizing the application.   
  The user is able to pre-allocate the CPU share for the application, maximum memory limits and even launch the container within a pre-allocated mount volume to limit the disk usage of the container.   
  Further, being able to select a distribution of your choice as the container rootfs significantly eases the requirements on the development of the application - if your application works on Ubuntu:16.04, then simply select Ubuntu:16.04 as the rootfs for the container image/tarball.  

  **The disadvantage** of container based applications is the lack of visibility compared to native applications, but owing to the rich RPC based APIs available with IOS-XR there isn't much that container applications cannot access on the system.   

  There are several examples of container applications that have built to operate on IOS-XR: a more recent one is when we ran Facebook's Open/R protocol as a docker application on IOS-XR. You can read more about it here:

## Understanding Linux Pkt/IO on IOS-XR

The most important component of the application hosting infrastructure that enables applications to open up TCP/UDP sockets, and send or receive  traffic across Management and production data interfaces of IOS-XR is the Pkt/IO infrastructure also commonly known as the KIM-Netstack infrastructure.


The core idea behind the Pkt/IO infrastructure in IOS-XR is to make the linux environment on an IOS-XR system appear identical to a typical Linux box.  
Now this would be simpler on a fixed (1RU or 2RU) system without any linecards by leveraging the inherent Linux network stack.

But today, there is no infrastructure available in the Linux ecosystem to manage Distributed systems with multiple linecards.   

This is where the IOS-XR network stack excels with its long history of running across fixed systems with no linecards as well as  modular systems with multiple linecards.   

<p style="margin: 2em 0!important;padding: 1em;font-family: CiscoSans,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: 1em !important;text-indent: initial;background-color: #e6f2f7;border-radius: 5px;box-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,127,171,0.25);">Knowing this, we implemented the Pkt/IO system such that the Linux kernel network stack on the RP in an IOS-XR platform can piggy-back on the IOS-XR network stack to allow the RP linux environment to have access to all the interfaces and packet paths on the distributed system for free, without any additional investment on the Linux kernel network stack.</p>  

The way we accomplish this is shown through the series of images below.  

Even though a distributed modular chassis consists of 1 or 2 RPs and multiple Linecards, each of which runs a Linux kernel and a Linux userspace environment on its own, a network operator or any end user typically has access only to the active RP of the system where all the interaction interfaces (CLI, APIs, SSH, Telnet) are available.   

So it makes sense to have a system that **mimics** a fixed (pizza-box) system for the Active RP's Linux kernel even on a distributed modular chassis. This way a Linux application running on the Active RP's linux environment will assume that it is on a fixed Linux box with all the (actually distributed) Linecard interfaces connected locally.


* **Expose Interface to the RP kernel**:  

   As shown below, all of the interfaces that you typically see in the `show ipv4 interface brief` command are mirrored into the RP's Linux kernel. The difference in the Name is that only a shorter form of the name is selected (`HundredGig` becomes `Hg`, `GigabitEthernet` becomes `Gi`) and the numbering is preserved with `/` replaced with `_`. So for example `HundredGig0/0/0/0` becomes `Hg0_0_0_0` in the Active RP's kernel.

   Currently, in IOS-XR only L3 interfaces are supported in the kernel. This includes Physical interfaces, Bundles Interfaces and Loopback interfaces only.
   Support for L2 interfaces (subinterfaces) will be coming in near future.

  <p text-align="center">
  <a href="assets/images/pkt_io_interfaces.png"><img alt="pkt-io-interfaces"  src="assets/images/pkt_io_interfaces.png"  style="display: block; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;"/></a>
  </p>

  <br/>

*  **Routes in the kernel**:  This was a decision with multiple implications. One way to solve the problem is to sync all routes from the IOS-XR RIB into the Active RP's kernel. This is possible but would be highly resource intensive to have two parallel RIBs on the system (one in IOS-XR, and the other in the kernel on the same node - RP), especially if the Router is being utilized to download internet Routing tables over BGP.  

   So, in order to save resources, we program only 3 potential routes into the kernel:
   *  **Default route**:  The default route is used to handover the packets from the RP's kernel to IOS-XR so that the lookup for the packet is done by the IOS-XR stack. There are two potential nexthop interfaces that the `default` route might point to:

    1. **fwdintf**: This is the default forwarding port to send packets from the RP over the fabric to the Linecards with the required platform headers to classify the packets as `tpa` packets (short for third party app). This interface has no ip address on it. So the packets exiting this interface cannot have their routing decision (outgoing linecard, interface, nexthop etc.) taken on the RP itself.  

        In this situation, the lookup for the packet's destination happens on the designated Linecard (every modular chassis has a designated linecard, used for packets for which the routing is not complete.). The designated Linecard then does a FIB lookup for the packet, sends the packet back over the fabric to the correct Linecard where it can finally exit the box.

    2. **fwd_ew**: This interface is also called the `netio` interface and its job is send the packet to the slow packet path and force IOS-XR software running on the Active RP to do a routing lookup before sending the packet out. This nexthop interface is used when packets need to be sent over the Mgmt port on the RP.  

        Another use case where this interface may be used is when a Linux process running in the RP's kernel network stack needs to communicate with a process running in the IOS-XR network stack. We call this `east-west` communication and hence the name `fwd_ew` for the interface. This interface too does not have an IP address and the Pkt/IO infrastructure opens up a raw socket on the interface to absorb traffic going out of it.  

    **So, irrespective of the nexthop interface for the default route, there MUST be a route to the required destination in IOS-XR RIB, since the final lookup (whether on RP or LC) will utilize the IOS-XR RIB/FIB routes.**
   * **Local Management Subnet**: This is obvious. The Management port is local to the RP, hence the Management port subnet is programmed into the kernel by default. This implies that irrespective of the `default` route in the kernel, you will always have reachability from the kernel to destinations on the Management LAN.<br/><br/>

 These routes are shown in the figure below, with the example showcasing a `default` route through `fwdintf`.

  <p text-align="center">
  <a href="assets/images/pkt_io_routes.png"><img alt="pkt-io-routes"  src="assets/images/pkt_io_routes.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;"/></a>
  </p>

  These routes are controlled through the `tpa` configuration CLI in IOS-XR:

  ```
      !
      tpa
      !
       vrf default
         !
         address-family ipv4
           default-route mgmt
           update-source MgmtEth0/RP0/CPU0/0
         !
         address-family ipv6
           default-route mgmt
           update-source MgmtEth0/RP0/CPU0/0
         !
       !
     !
  ```

  Where:

  * `vrf <>` defines the vrf (and hence the network namespace in the kernel) for which the route configurations are valid.
  * `address-family <>` determine the address family within the vrf/netns for which the route configurations are valid.
  * `default-route mgmt`:  This is a "Flag" CLI. Its presence forces the `default` route in kernel to use `fwd_ew` as the nexthop interface and thereby cause lookups to happen on RP through the slow packet path for application traffic originating from the Kernel. Its absence will change the default route to point to `fwdintf` interface instead.
  * `update-source <>`: This CLI is used to set the `src-hint` field in the linux route. Remember that Linux requires the outgoing interface to have an IP address to determine the source IP to be used for the packet destined to a particular destination in case the application does not set the source IP itself and depends on the kernel to do so. Since both `fwd_ew` and `fwdintf` are interfaces without any IP address, a src-hint must be set to ensure correct source-IP being set on the outgoing packet.

  If we apply the above configuration on an IOS-XR router (Release 6.3.1+), the routes in the kernel end up being:

  ```
  [r1:~]$ ip route
  default dev fwd_ew  scope link  src 192.168.122.21
  192.168.122.0/24 dev Mg0_RP0_CPU0_0  scope link  src 192.168.122.21
  [r1:~]$
  ```
  where `192.168.122.21` was the IP address of the `MgmtEth0/RP0/CPU0/0` interface that got configured as src-hint because of the `update-source` CLI under `tpa`.

  <br/>
* **Network Namespace**:   If a vrf (complete BGP vrf or just vrf-lite) is configured in IOS-XR CLI and the same vrf (same name) is configured under the `tpa` configuration, then a corresponding network namespace is allocated in the kernel with the same name as the VRF.   
  This is very useful when trying to isolate your applications into separate VRFs and running across specific interfaces.  

  If a vrf is mapped to a network namespace of the same name using the tpa CLI then Interfaces configured under the vrf in XR CLI will automatically be isolated into the corresponding namespace in the RP's kernel.

  </p>

  Let's try this out on route `r2` in the sandbox:

  <p style="margin: 2em 0!important;padding: 1em;font-family: CiscoSans,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: 1em !important;text-indent: initial;background-color: #e6f2f7;border-radius: 5px;box-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,127,171,0.25);">**Username**: admin<br/>**Password**: admin<br/>**SSH port**: 2231
  </p>  

  ```bash
  Laptop-terminal:$ ssh -p 2231 admin@10.10.20.170

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Router 2 (Cisco IOS XR Sandbox)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Password:

  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#
  ```
  Initially, the interface  `GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2` on router `r2` is shutdown and is by default in the `global-vrf` network namespace which corrsponds to vrf `default` in IOS-XR.  
  ```
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#show  running-config  int gigabitEthernet 0/0/0/2
  Mon Sep 10 05:13:15.645 UTC
  interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2
   shutdown
  !
  ```
  Check that this interface is visible in the `global-vrf` netns. We use `ifconfig -a` instead of just `ifconfig` since the interface is currently shutdown. We use the `netns_identify` utility in XR bash with the `$$` argument (represents the process ID of the current XR bash shell) to determine the netns we are dropped into when we issue the `bash` CLI in XR:

  ```
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#

  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#bash
  Mon Sep 10 05:13:30.038 UTC
  [r2:~]$
  [r2:~]$ netns_identify $$
  tpnns
  global-vrf
  [r2:~]$
  [r2:~]$ ifconfig -a Gi0_0_0_2
  Gi0_0_0_2 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 52:54:00:93:8a:b2

            TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

            RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)

  [r2:~]$
  ```
  Next, configure `vrf blue` at the global configuration level as well as under `tpa` to ensure that the netns called `blue` gets created in the kernel:  

  <p><pre><code>
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#conf t
  Mon Sep 10 05:14:16.867 UTC
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config)#vrf blue
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config-vrf)#tpa
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config-tpa)#vrf blue
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config-tpa-vrf)#exit
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config-tpa)#
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config-tpa)#
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config-tpa)#commit
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config)#
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#bash
  Mon Sep 10 05:14:39.438 UTC
  [r2:~]$ <mark>ls /var/run/netns
  blue  global-vrf  tpnns  xrnns</mark>
  [r2:~]$
  </code></pre></p>
  Perfect! Now configure interface `GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2` under `vrf blue` to trigger its migration in the kernel netns as well:  

  ```
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#conf t
  Mon Sep 10 05:14:54.079 UTC
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0/2

  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config-if)#ip addr 101.1.1.20/24
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config-if)#vrf blue
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config-if)#commit
  Mon Sep 10 05:15:15.502 UTC
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2(config-if)#
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#
  ```
  Drop into bash and check if `Gi0_0_0_2` is still present in `global-vrf` netns:

  ```
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r2#bash
  Mon Sep 10 05:15:19.643 UTC
  [r2:~]$
  [r2:~]$
  [r2:~]$ ifconfig -a Gi0_0_0_2
  Gi0_0_0_2: error fetching interface information: Device not found
  [r2:~]$
  ```
  Nope! now let's drop into netns `blue` and check the same:

  ```
  [r2:~]$ ip netns exec blue bash
  [r2:~]$
  [r2:~]$ source /etc/init.d/operns-functions
  [r2:~]$ netns_identify $$
  blue
  [r2:~]$
  [r2:~]$ ifconfig -a Gi0_0_0_2
  Gi0_0_0_2 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 52:54:00:93:8a:b2  
            inet addr:101.1.1.20  Mask:255.255.255.0
            inet6 addr: fe80::5054:ff:fe93:8ab2/64 Scope:Link
            UP RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
            RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
            TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

            RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)

  [r2:~]$
  ```
  Exactly what we expected. The interface `Gi0_0_0_2` has now migrated to netns `blue`.  


*  **KIM (kernel Interface Module)** The KIM module is an important part of the current IOS-XR architecture. It is an XR process that serves as an interface to Kernel (hence the name) and is used to trigger route creation, interface creation, vrf creation in the kernel in response to variable set of inputs:  User configured CLI (under `tpa`), Interface events from the interface manager and even RIB events for static routes through the Management port that are automatically synced into the kernel. KIM also handles the programming of LPTS (local packet transport services) in XR in response to netlink events that apps use to open sockets (TCP/UDP) in the kernel.

  * **Interface Sync**: As shown below, KIM utilizes interface manager events (shut/no-shut) to trigger a kernel module called LCND to create/delete/migrate mirrored interfaces corresponding to all the RP and LC interfaces in the kernel.  

    <p text-align="center">
    <a href="assets/images/kim_interface_setup.png"><img alt="kim-interface-setup"  src="assets/images/kim_interface_setup.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;"/></a>
    </p>


  * **Route Sync**: Similarly, as shown below, KIM will accept the `tpa` CLI as described earlier to determine the default routes, src-hints, next-hop interface etc. and program the kernel to reflect the requirement. It also works with RIB events to configure static routes with the Mgmt port as the next hop into the kernel (since the Mgmt port is local to the RP).

    <p text-align="center">
    <a href="assets/images/kim_route_setup.png"><img alt="kim-route-setup"  src="assets/images/kim_route_setup.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;"/></a>
    </p>  

  * **TCP/UDP socket sync**: When applications running (either natively or inside containers) attempt to open up TCP/UDP sockets, then it is essential for the IOS-XR LPTS framework (which is a distributed database of ports open on the system and exists across the RP and LCs) to be programmed to reflect these open ports so that any received packets can be subject to an LPTS lookup by an LC or RP and correctly forward the incoming traffic to the application opening up the socket.

  For this purpose, the netlink messages generated by the application when it tries to open sockets (TCP/UDP) in the kernel are captured by a kernel module and the events are forwarded to KIM, which in turn programs LPTS to reflect the newly opened sockets. A similar process also happens when the application closes the socket causing KIM to remove the entry from LPTS.

  <a href="assets/images/sync_lpts.png"><img alt="sync_lpts"  src="assets/images/sync_lpts.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;"/></a>
  </p>    


* **Traffic flow for Linux/Application Traffic**:  Let's take a quick look at how the traffic flow and lookups happen for application traffic with the Pkt/IO infrastructure in place for some unique scenarios:


  * **Transmit TCP/UDP traffic over Data ports**: In this scenario, typically, the `default` route is set up to point to `fwdintf` as the next hop interface. The packet generated from the userspace process/application, exits `fwdintf`, is captured by a kernel module listening on a raw socket on `fwdintf` and the packet is then injected into the fabric towards the designated Linecard.    
  The Designated linecard then does a FIB lookup, determines if it can directly send it out of the interface on the same linecard, else it sends it back over the fabric to the correct linecard based on the FIB lookup result.

  <p text-align="center">
  <a href="assets/images/transmit_tcp_udp_data.png"><img alt="receive_tcp_udp_data"  src="assets/images/transmit_tcp_udp_data.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;"/></a>
  </p>  

  * **Receive TCP/UDP traffic over Data port**: Here the packets arrive over the data port into the Linecard where an LPTS lookup takes place. Thanks to KIM which populates the LPTS entries based on TCP/UDP sockets opened by applications on the RP, the packets are then forwarded over the fabric towards the RP kernel and given to the application that opened up the matching socket.  

  <p text-align="center">
  <a href="assets/images/receive_tcp_udp_data.png"><img alt="receive_tcp_udp_data"  src="assets/images/receive_tcp_udp_data.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;"/></a>
  </p>  


  * **Receive Exception Traffic(ping)** Any traffic received that does not contain a layer 4 header specifying a TCP/UDP port is treated as exception traffic since it will not match any entry during LPTS lookup (which only handles TCP/UDP sockets). For such a packet, there will be a punt towards the RP's slow packet path where a software lookup will happen and the packet will be forwarded to the kernel as well as XR (replication). This is how a ping initiated in the Linux kernel of the RP will be able to receive a reply back.  

  <p text-align="center">
  <a href="assets/images/receive_exception_data.png"><img alt="receive_tcp_udp_data"  src="assets/images/receive_exception_data.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;"/></a>
  </p>  

  * **Management traffic Transmit/Receive**: This is fairly straightforward. All the traffic transmitted and received via the Local Management port on the RP is handled by the slow packet path as shown below.

  Transmit Traffic through Mgmt Port:

  </p>

## Native Applications on IOS-XR

If you've gone through some of the CLI automation labs already, then it must be fairly clear that being able to run bash and python scripts natively in the XR shell is fairly common. Extend that to cron jobs and you get all the typical scripting capabilities that you expect on a Linux environment.  


Further, IOS-XR uses the Windriver Linux 7 (WRL7) distribution which is RPM based and also support yum natively for WRL7 applications.  
You can certainly build your own WRL7 RPMs and install them on the system. This scenario is covered in great detail on xrdocs, here:
><https://xrdocs.io/application-hosting/tutorials/2016-06-17-xr-toolbox-part-5-running-a-native-wrl7-app/>

Further, the IOS-XR team also hosts some pre-built libraries for common Linux applications on the Yum repository here:  

><https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/xr600/3rdparty/x86_64/>

To show how a native application RPM could be installed from this yum repo, let's connect to router `r1` in the sandbox:

<p style="margin: 2em 0!important;padding: 1em;font-family: CiscoSans,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: 1em !important;text-indent: initial;background-color: #e6f2f7;border-radius: 5px;box-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,127,171,0.25);">**Username**: admin<br/>**Password**: admin<br/>**SSH port**: 2221
</p>  

```bash
Laptop-terminal:$ ssh -p 2221 admin@10.10.20.170


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Router 1 (Cisco IOS XR Sandbox)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Password:


RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#

```

Drop into the bash shell and run `ip route`:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#bash
Mon Sep 10 01:56:15.560 UTC

[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ ip route
default dev fwdintf  scope link
192.168.122.0/24 dev Mg0_RP0_CPU0_0  scope link  src 192.168.122.21
[r1:~]$
```

It can be seen that the current default route for the global-vrf network namespace in the shell is set to go over the fabric and expects the default route in IOS-XR RIB to contain a route to the internet over the data ports.

But the way the sandbox VMs are connected, internet access is available over the Management port sitting behind the gateway `192.168.122.1` and natted to the external world. Therefore to establish connectivity to the yum repo, we need to configure both the default route and the update-source config (setting the source IP of outgoing packets) to point to the Management port.  

Configuring thus:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1(config)#tpa
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1(config-tpa)#vrf default
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1(config-tpa-vrf)#address-family ipv4

end

```

We can now check the output of `ip route` again:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#bash
Mon Sep 10 02:09:25.572 UTC
[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ ip route
default dev fwd_ew  scope link  src 192.168.122.21
192.168.122.0/24 dev Mg0_RP0_CPU0_0  scope link  src 192.168.122.21
[r1:~]$

```

Great, notice how the default route changed to point to the `fwd_ew` interface so that the packet will be sent to the slow packet path where IOS-XR can also forward packets out to the Management port.  

Finally, set up the dns resolution by adding a nameserver to `/etc/resolv.conf` through the `bash` cli:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#bash
Mon Sep 10 01:56:15.560 UTC

[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ ping google.com
ping: unknown host google.com
[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf

[r1:~]$ ping google.com

[r1:~]$

```

Perfect, we now have DNS resolving towards the internet, so let's set up access to the yum repo, Again in the bash shell :

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#bash
Mon Sep 10 01:56:15.560 UTC

[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ yum-config-manager --add-repo https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/xr600/3rdparty/x86_64/

[r1:~]$
```

Let's install the available `iperf` RPM from the yum repo:


```
[r1:~]$

## Container applications on IOS-XR

Some common setup details for both LXC containers and Docker containers on the IOS-XR system are:

*  **Disk Volume**: By default the mount volume `/misc/app_host` on the underlying host layer is mounted into the XR LXC by default. The amount of space allocated is about 3.9G on an xrv9k and about 3.7G on an NCS5500. It varies based on the resource availability of the platform, but is within this range.This can be checked by running `df -h` in the bash shell:

  <p><pre><code>

  [r1:~]$
  </code></pre></p>


* **CPU shares**: Both LXC containers and Docker containers on IOS-XR have their resources (CPU/Memory) governed by cgroups settings. To figure out the limits on these container applications by default, we need to drop into the Host shell and check the cgroups settings:

    To drop into the host shell, follow the exact sequence of commands shown below, starting from the XR CLI:

    <p><pre><code>
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#<mark>admin</mark>
    Mon Sep 10 02:33:43.456 UTC

    admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on r1
    sysadmin-vm:0_RP0#<mark>run</mark>
    Mon Sep  10 02:33:45.243 UTC

    [sysadmin-vm:0_RP0:~]$
    [sysadmin-vm:0_RP0:~]$<mark>ssh 10.0.2.16</mark>
    [host:~]$
    </code></pre></p>

    Once in the host shell, check the cpu shares allocated for LXCs by checking the content of the file: `/dev/cgroup/cpu/machine/tp_app.partition/lxc.partition/cpu.shares `

    ```      
    [host:~]$ cat /dev/cgroup/cpu/machine/tp_app.partition/lxc.partition/cpu.shares
    1024
    [host:~]$
    ```
    Now, what do these CPU shares mean?

    Let's check the allocated cpu shares for the other machines on the host layer:

    ```
    [host:~]$ cat /dev/cgroup/cpu/machine/default-sdr--1.libvirt-lxc/cpu.shares
    1024
    [host:~]$ cat /dev/cgroup/cpu/machine/default-sdr--2.libvirt-lxc/cpu.shares
    1024
    [host:~]$ cat /dev/cgroup/cpu/machine/sysadmin.libvirt-lxc/cpu.shares
    1024
    [host:~]$ cat /dev/cgroup/cpu/machine/cpu.shares                      
    1024
    [host:~]$
    [host:~]$ cat /dev/cgroup/cpu/machine/tp_app.partition/docker/cpu.shares        
    1024
    [host:~]$
    ```
    What these values indicate is that an equal number of shares (1024) are allocated to default-sdr-1, default-sdr-2, sysadmin LXC, user LXCs, and docker containers.

    Thus, we can calculate that the percentage of the CPU that is available for a user LXC on the system is:

    ```
    % CPU allocated for User LXCs =    (cpu shares for User LXCs)
                                     _________________________________ * 100
                                    (sum of cpu shares of all machines)
    ```                                 

    Based of this we, get:

    ```
    % CPU allocated for User LXCs = (1024)/(1024+ 1024+ 1024+1024+1024+1024) *100
                                  = 16.67%

    ```  

    The same holds true for the docker partition as well, as we saw above, so,

    ```
    % CPU allocated for Docker containers = 16.67%
    ```


* **Memory Limits**: Similarly, cgroups settings on the host shell can also be used to determine the maximum limit on the amount of memory that a container app can utilize on the system:  

    ```
    [host:~]$ cat /dev/cgroup/memory/machine/tp_app.partition/lxc.partition/memory.limit_in_bytes     
    536870912
    [host:~]$
    [host:~]$ cat /dev/cgroup/memory/machine/tp_app.partition/docker/memory.limit_in_bytes        
    536870912
    [host:~]$

    ```

    The above values are in bytes but it translates to 512 MB memory limit on container apps.


<p style="margin: 2em 0 !important;padding: 1em;font-family: CiscoSans,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: 1em !important;text-indent: initial;background-color: #e6f2f7;border-radius: 5px;box-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,127,171,0.25);">
Bear in mind that the above values are for an IOS-XRv9000 platform. Each platform would handle these limits based on the resources available. But you can use the same techniques described above across all IOS-XR platforms to determine the limits imposed by the one selected.

### LXC Containers

The libvirt daemon runs on the host layer of the system. However the interaction client for libvirt, i.e. virsh has been made available for use within the XR LXC for end users.  
These implies that a user in the XR bash shell can run the `virsh` command to display the running containers or even launch new custom containers:  

Trying this out on router `r1`:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#bash
Mon Sep 10 02:20:21.486 UTC

[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ virsh list
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 7554  sysadmin                       running
 17021 default-sdr--1                 running
 27481 default-sdr--2                 running

[r1:~]$

```
Here `sysadmin` corresponds to the admin LXC and `default-sdr--1` corresponds to the XR LXC. Further, since `r1` is a virtual XRv9000 platform, it doesn't contain physical linecards. Hence the XR LXC that would typically run on a linecard runs as a separate LXC on the RP host itself to mimic the behaviour of a linecard on an XRv9000.  

Bringing up your own LXC container on IOS-XR is fairly simple, and this has been covered in great detail on xrdocs, here:

><https://xrdocs.io/application-hosting/tutorials/2016-06-16-xr-toolbox-part-4-bring-your-own-container-lxc-app/>  

We will skip bringing up an LXC container and will leave it as a exercise for the reader based on the blog above.  


### Docker Containers

The Docker daemon runs on the host layer as well, much like the libvirt daemon. Again, to simplify operations, the docker client has been made available in the XR bash shell.  
Drop into the `bash` shell of router `r1`, so we can play around with the docker client:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#bash
Mon Sep 10 02:20:21.486 UTC

[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
[r1:~]$
```

There are multiple different techniques that can be used to bring up a docker container on IOS-XR and all of them are discussed in great detail on xrdocs, here:

><https://xrdocs.io/application-hosting/tutorials/2017-02-26-running-docker-containers-on-ios-xr-6-1-2/>


Since docker supports pulling docker images directly from dockerhub over the internet, we can try a quick demonstration. If you already ran through the steps to set up the yum repository and install `iperf` in the native application example above, then your `bash` in the XR LXC must have the following routes:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:r1#bash
Mon Sep 10 03:02:56.144 UTC

[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ ip route
default dev fwd_ew  scope link  src 192.168.122.21
192.168.122.0/24 dev Mg0_RP0_CPU0_0  scope link  src 192.168.122.21
[r1:~]$
```

To demonstrate how the IOS-XR Pkt/IO environment can be inherited by the docker container, we pull in a pre-built ubuntu container with `iproute2` pre-installed from dockerhub.   

The advantage of `iproute2` being available is that we can execute the `ip netns exec` commands inside the container to change into the the required mounted netns where the container will have full access to the exposed IOS-XR interfaces and routes in the kernel.

#### Pull the ubuntu_iproute2 docker image

```
[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ docker pull akshshar/ubuntu_iproute2_docker

[r1:~]$
```

You should see the pulled docker image using the `docker images` command:  

```
[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ docker images
REPOSITORY                        TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE

[r1:~]$
```

Next, launch the docker image with the following essential parameters:

*  `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN`: This is capability added to the container to give it enough privileges to run the `ip netns exec <>` command.
*  `-v /var/run/netns:/var/run/netns`:  The `-v` flag is a mount flag that will mount the `/var/run/netns` volume from the host into the docker container.  This ensures that all the network namespaces created in the kernel by IOS-XR are available for use within the container's filesystem.  


<p><pre><code>
[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ <mark>docker run -itd --name ubuntu_iproute2 --cap-add SYS_ADMIN -v /var/run/netns:/var/run/netns akshshar/ubuntu_iproute2_docker bash</mark>
871fe3fd745e903b3652ad89e013e83b64fa476ca79731037f9542c1fbca8b7f
[r1:~]$
</code></pre></p>


Check that the container is now running:

```
[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                             COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
871fe3fd745e        akshshar/ubuntu_iproute2_docker   "bash"              25 minutes ago      Up 25 minutes                           ubuntu_iproute2
[r1:~]$
```

Exec into the container:

```
[r1:~]$
[r1:~]$ docker exec -it ubuntu_iproute2 bash
root@871fe3fd745e:/#
```

Exec into the `global-vrf` network namespace to gain access to all the interfaces and routes:  

```
root@871fe3fd745e:/# ip netns exec global-vrf bash
root@871fe3fd745e:/#
